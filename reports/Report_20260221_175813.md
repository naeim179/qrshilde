## 🤖 AI Deep Analysis (Gemini/Groq)
### Analysis of QR Payload

**Payload:** `http://secure-paypal-update.com/login?verify=true&urgent=1`

#### 1. Identified Attacks
*   **Phishing / Credential Harvesting:** The site impersonates PayPal to steal login credentials.
*   **Brand Spoofing:** Use of "paypal" in a non-official domain to deceive users.
*   **Typosquatting/Lookalike Domain:** Using a domain that looks legitimate (`secure-paypal-update.com`) but is not owned by the official entity (`paypal.com`).

#### 2. Security Risks
*   **Identity Theft:** High risk of account takeover and financial loss.
*   **Insecure Protocol (HTTP):** The payload uses `http://` instead of `https://`. Any data entered is sent in plaintext and susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) sniffing.
*   **Social Engineering:** The parameters `verify=true` and `urgent=1` are designed to trigger a psychological "fear of loss" or "sense of urgency" to bypass critical thinking.

#### 3. Obfuscation Techniques
*   **Semantic Camouflage:** Using keywords like "secure" and "update" to build false trust.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Using legitimate-looking query strings to make the URL appear functional and official.
*   **Visual Obfuscation:** While the text is clear, QR codes themselves are a form of obfuscation, as humans cannot read the underlying URL without scanning it first (Quishing).

**Verdict: MALICIOUS.** This is a high-risk phishing link. Do not visit.
