### 🤖 AI Analysis:
### **Security Analysis: QR Payload**

**Payload:** `http://example.com/login/update`

---

#### **1. Identified Attacks**
*   **Quishing (QR Phishing):** The use of a QR code to deliver a URL is a classic social engineering tactic to bypass email filters and security gateways.
*   **Credential Harvesting:** The path `/login/update` is a high-signal indicator of a phishing page designed to steal usernames and passwords.

#### **2. Risks**
*   **Insecure Protocol (Cleartext):** The use of `http://` instead of `https://` means any data entered (credentials, PII) is transmitted in plaintext, vulnerable to **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** sniffing.
*   **Account Takeover (ATO):** Success leads to unauthorized access to the user's account.
*   **Placeholder Domain:** While `example.com` is a reserved documentation domain, in a live environment, this would represent a **Typosquatted** or **Look-alike domain** designed to mimic a legitimate service.

#### **3. Obfuscation**
*   **None (Direct):** The payload itself is not obfuscated (no Base64, URL encoding, or shorteners). 
*   **QR-Level Obfuscation:** The "obfuscation" lies in the medium; humans cannot parse the destination URL visually, relying entirely on the scanner's preview, which users often ignore.

### **Verdict: MALICIOUS / HIGH RISK**
**Reasoning:** The combination of an insecure protocol (HTTP) and an urgent-action path (`/login/update`) is a definitive signature of a credential harvesting attack. **Do not interact.**
