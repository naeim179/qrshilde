**Date:** 2026-02-26 23:10:20 | **ID:** 20260226_231012
## 📊 Verdict: SUSPICIOUS (35/100)

### 🔍 Findings:
- ⚠️ Payload type: wifi
- ⚠️ Weak Encryption (WEP) - Easily Hacked.

### 🤖 AI Analysis:
### Security Analysis: QR Wi-Fi Payload

**Payload:** `WIFI:T:WEP;S:FreeWifi;P:12345678;H:true;;`

---

#### 1. Attack Vectors
*   **Evil Twin / Rogue AP:** The generic SSID `FreeWifi` is a prime candidate for an "Evil Twin" attack where an attacker mimics this network to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) interceptions.
*   **WEP Cracking:** The payload specifies **WEP** (Wired Equivalent Privacy). WEP is cryptographically broken and can be cracked in minutes using standard tools (e.g., Aircrack-ng).
*   **Brute-Force:** The password `12345678` is a top-tier common password, vulnerable to instant dictionary attacks.

#### 2. Identified Risks
*   **Critical Protocol Vulnerability:** WEP is deprecated and insecure. It provides virtually no protection against modern threats.
*   **Privacy Leakage (Hidden SSID):** Setting `H:true` (Hidden) forces client devices to broadcast "probes" for this network wherever they go. This allows attackers to track the user’s movement and identifies the user's home/work network history.
*   **Data Interception:** Because the encryption is weak, any data transmitted over this connection (HTTP traffic, DNS queries) is easily sniffable by nearby actors.

#### 3. Obfuscation
*   **None:** The payload follows the standard MECARD/Wi-Fi format with no encoding (Base64), character substitution, or padding used to hide its intent.

### **Verdict: HIGH RISK / INSECURE**
The payload describes a network with obsolete security, a trivial password, and a configuration that compromises user privacy. It is likely either an **intentionally weak "honeypot"** designed to capture traffic or a poorly configured legacy system. **Do not connect.**
