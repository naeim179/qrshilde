### 🧠 ML Result:
- Label: **phishing**
- Phishing Probability: **0.3244**
- Threshold: **0.31**

**Top ML signals:**
- special_count: 2.6577
- keyword_hits: -1.4821
- tld_len: -1.1857
- path_len: -0.5963
- host_len: 0.0790

### 🤖 AI Analysis:
**Summary:** The URL points to 'example.com', which is a reserved domain designated by IETF standards for use in documentation and examples. While the path suggests a login or update action, the domain itself is non-functional for hosting external content.

**Suspicious signals:**
- Use of insecure HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS
- The path '/login/update' uses keywords frequently targeted in credential harvesting simulations

**Benign signals:**
- Domain is a reserved placeholder (RFC 2606) for documentation and testing
- The domain is not associated with any active malicious infrastructure

**Recommendation:** Since this is a documentation domain, it is harmless. For actual websites, verify the domain name matches the intended service and ensure the connection is encrypted via HTTPS before entering any information.
