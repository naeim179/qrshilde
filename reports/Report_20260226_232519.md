**Date:** 2026-02-26 23:25:26 | **ID:** 20260226_232519
## 📊 Verdict: SUSPICIOUS (35/100)

### 🔍 Findings:
- ⚠️ Payload type: wifi
- ⚠️ Weak Encryption (WEP) - Easily Hacked.

### 🤖 AI Analysis:
**Summary:** This QR code contains configuration details for a Wi-Fi network with the SSID 'FreeWifi'. It utilizes the legacy WEP encryption protocol and indicates the network is hidden.

**Suspicious signals:**
- Uses WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), a deprecated encryption standard that is highly vulnerable to modern decryption attacks.
- The SSID 'FreeWifi' is generic and frequently associated with honeypots or rogue access points.
- The password '12345678' is a common, weak credential that is easily guessed or brute-forced.
- Hidden SSIDs are not a security feature and may cause client devices to leak the network name while searching for it.

**Benign signals:**
- The payload adheres to the standard 'WIFI:' URI syntax used for automated network configuration.
- There are no embedded URLs, phishing links, or executable scripts.

**Recommendation:** Avoid connecting to this network as WEP provides inadequate security for data protection. If you are the administrator, upgrade the security protocol to WPA2 or WPA3 and implement a more complex password.
