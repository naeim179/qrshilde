### 🧠 ML Result:
- Label: **phishing**
- Phishing Probability: **0.3244**
- Threshold: **0.31**

**Top ML signals:**
- special_count: 2.6577
- keyword_hits: -1.4821
- tld_len: -1.1857
- path_len: -0.5963
- host_len: 0.0790

### 🤖 AI Analysis:
**Summary:** The URL points to example.com, which is a reserved domain established by the IETF for documentation and illustrative purposes. While the path structure suggests a login or account update page, the domain cannot host functional malicious content or live services.

**Suspicious signals:**
- Use of unencrypted HTTP protocol
- URL path includes sensitive keywords ('login', 'update') often associated with credential harvesting

**Benign signals:**
- The domain 'example.com' is a globally recognized placeholder domain for documentation (RFC 2606)
- The domain is not a functional website for processing user data

**Recommendation:** Recognize this as a documentation or test URL. No action is required as the domain is non-functional for real-world transactions.
