## 📊 Verdict: SAFE (0/100)

### 🔍 Findings:
- ⚠️ Payload type: sms

### 🤖 AI Analysis:
**Summary:** The payload is an SMS template (SMSTO) pre-configured to send a message to a mobile number in Jordan. The message body contains a high-pressure request for bank OTP verification.

**Suspicious signals:**
- Use of urgent language ('URGENT') to prompt immediate action.
- Request for sensitive banking information (OTP), which is a characteristic of smishing attempts.
- The destination is a standard mobile number rather than an official short code typically used by financial institutions.

**Benign signals:**
- The phone number is formatted correctly according to international standards.

**Recommendation:** Do not send the SMS. If you are concerned about your bank account, contact your financial institution through their official website or the phone number on the back of your debit/credit card.
