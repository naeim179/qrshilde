**Date:** 2026-02-26 23:36:41 | **ID:** 20260226_233635
## 📊 Verdict: SAFE (0/100)

### 🔍 Findings:
- ⚠️ Payload type: tel

### 🤖 AI Analysis:
**Summary:** The payload is a 'tel:' URI scheme intended to initiate a phone call to the number +18005550199. This specific number is part of a block (555-0100 through 555-0199) reserved for fictional use and documentation within the North American Numbering Plan.

**Benign signals:**
- Uses a standard URI scheme for telephony
- Target number is a reserved fictional placeholder
- Toll-free prefix used

**Recommendation:** Treat this as a documentation or test string. In a real-world scenario, users should verify the destination of a phone call before dialing, as 'tel:' links can be used to facilitate vishing or toll fraud.
