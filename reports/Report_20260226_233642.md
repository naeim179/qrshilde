**Date:** 2026-02-26 23:36:49 | **ID:** 20260226_233642
## 📊 Verdict: SAFE (0/100)

### 🔍 Findings:
- ⚠️ Payload type: vcard

### 🤖 AI Analysis:
**Summary:** The payload is a vCard contact file that includes a link to an external website masquerading as a PayPal security verification page.

**Suspicious signals:**
- The domain 'secure-paypal-login.com' uses the 'PayPal' brand name in a non-official context (cybersquatting).
- The URL uses the unencrypted HTTP protocol rather than HTTPS.
- The use of a generic 'Support Team' identity is a common tactic in social engineering and phishing.
- The URL path '/verify' is typical for credential harvesting attempts.

**Benign signals:**
- The data is structured in a standard, valid vCard 3.0 format.

**Recommendation:** Do not visit the URL or provide any sensitive information. If you need to verify your PayPal account status, visit the official website directly by typing 'paypal.com' into your browser.
