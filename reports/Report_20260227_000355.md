**Date:** 2026-02-27 00:04:01 | **ID:** 20260227_000355
## 📊 Verdict: SUSPICIOUS (45/100)

### 🔍 Findings:
- ⚠️ Payload type: sms
- ⚠️ SMS QR: May trigger composing/sending an SMS (social engineering risk).
- ⚠️ SMS Heuristic: smishing keywords detected (otp/bank/urgent/verify/...)

### 🤖 AI Analysis:
**Summary:** The payload is an SMSTO protocol link designed to send a text message to a Jordanian phone number (+962799999999) containing a request for urgent bank OTP verification.

**Suspicious signals:**
- Use of high-pressure, alarmist language ('URGENT')
- Requests the user to facilitate a bank OTP (One-Time Password) verification, a common tactic in smishing attacks
- Generic messaging that does not identify a specific financial institution

**Benign signals:**
- Uses a standard, transparent SMSTO protocol

**Recommendation:** Do not send the pre-filled SMS. If you suspect an issue with your bank account, contact your financial institution directly using an official number from their website or the back of your debit/credit card.
